# First React Application

## Introduction
Welcome to my first React application. This project is meant to showcase the power and simplicity of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The primary goal is to illustrate the ease of using React compared to vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation and to demonstrate the integration of external APIs.
